#+TITLE: st - simple terminal
A fork of [[https://st.suckless.org][st]], a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

*** Requirements
- In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

- You must install *harfbuzz* lib for ligatures and maybe [[https://github.com/jgsn13/libxft-bgra][libxft-bgra]] (or similar) if st crashes when viewing emogis.

- A compositor like *picom*.

- A [[https://www.nerdfonts.com][Nerd Font]] (I'm using *FiraCode NF* btw) and, optionally, a font for emojis like *Noto Color Emoji*.

- `xorg-xev` if you want to find key values and customize the shortcuts.


*** Notes
- If you want to add new [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/][patches]], do it manually by reading the *.diff* files and removing/adding new lines, otherwise you'll get annoying bugs/errors.

*** Installation
- Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

- Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):
#+begin_src sh
make clean install
#+end_src
